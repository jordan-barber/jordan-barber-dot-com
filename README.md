This is my personal portfolio. Feel free to use this Gatsby application as a template for your own portfolio. This uses technologies such as
<a href="styled-components.com">Styled Components</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone the repo.**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jordan-barber/jordan-barber-io.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd jordan-barber-io/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
